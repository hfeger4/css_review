BSTNode = Struct.new(:value, :left, :right)
Ez quick way to make a BST in Ruby

BSTNode.new(x) - Makes new binary search tree node.
x is the value, you can also pass the children's stuff.

AVL Tree - Self balancing bst.

BST API:
Insert Logn
Find Logn
Delete Logn


How to determine if a BST is balanced:
if root == nil
  return True
DFS on every other root, ensure that the difference is never greater than 1.

def in order transversal(root, arr = [])
  if root.left
    in order(root.left, arr)
  and
    arr.push(root)

  if root.right
    in_order(root.right, arr)
  end
  arr
